                <h2>Cook the Onions</h2>
                <p>
                    In a largecast-iron skillet pan set over medium to medium-high heat,
                    add 1 tablespoon of butter and sliced onions. Cook oinons, stirring occasionally,
                    for about 25 minutes until they are a deep brown color.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Near the end, add apple cider vinegae and stir to combine. Then remove from the
                    skillet.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Cook the Patties</h2>
                <p>
                    Shape the ground beef into 2 thin 4-ounce patties that are roughly the 
                    shape of your bread. Season the patties with salt and pepper.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the onions are doine in your skillet, set the heat to medium-high and
                    add the patties. Cook for 3 minutes per side. Remove the patties when done.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Butter your Bread</h2>
                <p>
                    Wipe your skillet clean and add a tablespoon of butter to the skillet. 
                    Once the butter melts, add the bread slices to the skillet so that each slice
                    is evenly coated in butter.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Build your sandwiches in the skillet</h2>
                <p>
                    On each slice of bread remaining on the skillet, add one slice of Swiss chesse, a patty,
                    half of the onons, and top it off with a second slice of Swiss chesse. Top each sandwich off
                    with the slice of bread removed from the skillet earlier, buttered sided up.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Cook the Sandwiches</h2>
                <p>
                    Over medium-low heat, cook the sandwiches for 3-4 munites per side until the bread
                    is toasted and the chesse is melted.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>
            After that, slice the sandwiches in half and serve while still immediately warm. Enjoy!
