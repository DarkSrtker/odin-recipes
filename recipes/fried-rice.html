        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          This fried rice is easily better than takeout! It only takes 20 minutes to make and is full of
          eggs and veggies that amke it healthy and give it loads of flavor!  
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Rice, make sure that it's a day old and cold as this is the key to make the 
                best homeade rice ever. You can use day old brown rice as well, but doing so will
                create a less authentic flavor and taste.  
            </li>

            <li>
                Sesame Oil, another ingredient I do not reccomend ommitting as it is the key to
                the authentic flavor.
            </li>

            <li>
                Peanit oil, you can substitiute it for canola oil if you're allergic.
